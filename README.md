# CSC314-Data_Mining

## Catalog Description
Data mining is concerned with the extraction of information from large
amounts of data. This project-based course introduces the concepts,
issues, tasks and techniques of data mining. Topics include data
preparation and feature selection, classification, clustering,
evaluation and validation, and data mining applications.

## Quote
Big data is like teenage sex;
   everyone talks about,
nobody really knows how to do it,
everyone thinks everyone else is doing it,
so everyone claims they are doing it.

Dan Ariely, Duke University
